00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.615
So, what does it look like when you apply optical flow not just to a point,

00:00:04.615 --> 00:00:06.720
but a set of points in a video?

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:09.539
Take the small image of a robot that moves to the right

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:12.724
and then down into the right and the next two image frames.

00:00:12.724 --> 00:00:14.669
The goal of optical flow is,

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:16.000
for each image frame,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.980
to compute approximate motion vectors based on how the image intensity,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.500
the patterns of dark and light pixels have changed over time.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.929
The first step is to find matching feature points in between two images using

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.549
a method by cog or corner detection that looks for matching patterns of intensity.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:37.244
In this case, we will directly detect some endpoints and maybe the sensors on the robot.

00:00:37.244 --> 00:00:40.234
Then optical flow calculates a motion vector,

00:00:40.234 --> 00:00:43.094
UV for each key point in the first image frame

00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:46.799
that points to where that key point can be found in the next image.

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:50.549
These motion vectors are to the right between frames one and two,

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:53.589
and then down into the right between frames two and three.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.810
This is what optical flow will look like for a set of points and you can calculate

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.140
this flow frame by frame until you build up the path of an object over time.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.834
You can imagine using this data to measure the velocity of that object.

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:08.549
You can also apply this technique to every pixel in

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.454
an image to create a field of motion vectors.

00:01:11.454 --> 00:01:14.810
Optical flow is used in a variety of applications

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.185
from slow motion graphics to autonomous vehicle navigation,

00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:22.040
and it will be especially useful to keep these motion vectors in mind as we

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.000
approach the task of locating a robot as it moves through an environment.
