00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.910
Now, optical flow assumes that points in one image frame have

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.460
the same intensity pixel value as those same points in the next image frame.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.605
That is optical flow assumes that the color of a surface will stay the same over time.

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:17.804
In practice, this is not a perfect assumption but it's close most of the time.

00:00:17.804 --> 00:00:19.129
So in these images,

00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:21.439
which I'll call I_1 and I_2,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.205
the intensity at the point x,

00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:28.699
y in this first image is the same as the intensity in image two at the point x plus u,

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.679
y plus v. So far,

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.460
we have treated these as two separate images in x and y space,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.685
but we also know that they're related in time.

00:00:36.685 --> 00:00:38.660
How do you think we can mathematically

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.739
represent that image one comes right before image two?

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.140
To relate image frames in space and time,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.704
we can think about these image frames in another way.

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:53.509
This first image is just the 2D pattern of intensity that happens at time t,

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:57.969
and the second image is the intensity pattern that happens at time t plus one,

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.554
one time step later.

00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:03.019
In this way, we can think of a series of image frames I as

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.490
a 3D volume of images with x and y coordinates,

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:08.125
pixel values at each point,

00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:10.344
and a depth dimension of time.

00:01:10.344 --> 00:01:14.614
We can write this intensity equation as a function of x and y

00:01:14.614 --> 00:01:19.459
and t. This equation is known as the brightness constancy assumption.

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:23.834
This function can be broken down into something called a Taylor series expansion,

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:27.879
which represents this intensity function as a summation of terms.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:30.019
In this case, the terms I calculated as

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:33.024
the derivatives of the intensity with respect to x,

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:36.270
y and t. We can simplify this expansion,

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:40.329
and the result is an equation that relates the motion vector quantities u and

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.549
v to the change in image intensity in space and in time,

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.379
which are measurable changes.

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:49.599
This is the foundation of how optical flow estimates

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:53.199
the motion vectors for a set of feature points in a video.
