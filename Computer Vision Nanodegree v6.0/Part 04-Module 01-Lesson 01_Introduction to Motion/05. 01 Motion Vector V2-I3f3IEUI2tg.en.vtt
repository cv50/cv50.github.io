00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.169
So, how exactly does optical flow work?

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.310
We know that it tries to track points from one image frame to

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.185
another based on the intensity levels of points in each image.

00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:17.280
Let's see this in a simple example.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.929
Say we have two image frames from a video,

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.454
and for one point on object in image one,

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:25.195
we want to find out where it is in image two.

00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:28.260
Once we do, we can calculate a motion vector that

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.045
describes the velocity of this point from the first frame to the next.

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:33.829
The math works like this,

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.394
a point in our first image (x,y),

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:38.815
will move some amount from this frame to the next.

00:00:38.814 --> 00:00:41.909
It will have moved some distance u horizontally,

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.039
and some distance v vertically.

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.810
So in the second image frame,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.219
that point will be at the coordinate x plus u and y plus

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.200
v. This motion can be described by a motion vector (u, v).

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.960
Vector is a quantity that has a magnitude and a direction.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.234
Let's say that a point has moved three pixels to the right, and four pixels up,

00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:04.980
then our point (x,y) in the first frame will be

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.025
at x plus three y plus four in the second frame.

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:10.740
The motion vector will be (3,4).

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:12.780
The magnitude of any vector in x,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.129
y space can be found by the Pythagorean theorem for sides of a triangle.

00:01:17.129 --> 00:01:19.494
A-squared plus b-squared equals c-squared.

00:01:19.495 --> 00:01:22.260
So in this case, the magnitude of the vector equals

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.230
the square root of three squared plus four squared,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.075
that's the square root of 25, which is five.

00:01:28.075 --> 00:01:31.799
The orientation of this vector can be found using trigonometry.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.030
Where the angle equals the inverse tangent of four over three,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.894
which is about 53.13 degrees.

00:01:38.894 --> 00:01:43.679
Knowing the magnitude and direction of a moving point or a set of moving points,

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.990
is all you really need to know to track an object.

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:50.879
Next, we'll learn more about how optical flow estimates motion vectors like these.
