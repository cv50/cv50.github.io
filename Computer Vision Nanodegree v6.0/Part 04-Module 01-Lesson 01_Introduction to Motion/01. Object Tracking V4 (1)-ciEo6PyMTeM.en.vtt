00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.509
So far, you've learned a lot about how to extract important information from images and

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:15.654
how to use deep learning techniques to recognize patterns in images and identify objects.

00:00:15.654 --> 00:00:17.160
In this part of the course,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.109
we'll focus less on images and more on pattern recognition over time and space.

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.699
We'll talk about different computer vision methods for

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.519
tracking objects and predicting their movement.

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:28.879
In fact, in this lesson,

00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:31.329
you'll be programming a filter that tracks a robot

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:34.259
as it moves and senses its environment over time.

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:36.879
This requires having a model of motion and

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.495
the mathematical way to represent uncertainty in that motion.

00:00:40.494 --> 00:00:43.409
Finding out where a moving object is located with

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.404
some certainty at any given time is called localization.

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:50.219
Localization techniques are used extensively in

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.019
computer graphics applications that track certain objects and people over time,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.790
and localization is used in autonomous vehicles,

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.329
like in self-driving cars that need to know where

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.394
they are in the world so that they can safely navigate.

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:08.140
Next, let's talk about the specific skills that we'll cover in the next few lessons.
