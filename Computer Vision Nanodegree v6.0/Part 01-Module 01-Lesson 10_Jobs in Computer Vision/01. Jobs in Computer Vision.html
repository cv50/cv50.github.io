          Computer vision and related fields in AI are so fast-moving. Find opportunities by staying on top of new developments.
         </p>
         <p>
          We recommend a 3-part strategy to finding opportunities in computer vision.
         </p>
         <ol>
          <li>
           <strong>
            Stay updated on thought leadership.

            See how computer vision fits into common image analysis and machine learning roles
           </strong>
           , ranging from researcher to image analyst to software engineer. Do job searches based on skills (such as feature extraction or SLAM), rather than job title. You will find more opportunities.

           <strong>
            Create your own computer vision application and share it!

           Job seekers ask Udacity Careers all the time on how to talk about their skills and experiences - better than talking is showing. Develop your own app or product (it can be a small, personal project!), put the work online (ie: upload your code on GitHub), and then write a blog post documenting the development process and purpose of the project. You can pursue both software and hardware projects.

         </h2>
         <p>
          In the Computer Vision Nanodegree program, you will gain insights into and practice these core computer vision skills:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Implement image processing techniques like color and geometric transforms
          </li>
          <li>
           Create and apply convolutional filters to images to smooth them or detect object edges
          </li>
          <li>
           Apply feature extraction methods like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and ORB to detect features like the eyes and mouth on a face
          </li>
          <li>
           Implement k-means clustering and contour detection to find areas with similar traits in an image
          </li>
          <li>
           Define and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify different items of clothing
          </li>
          <li>
           Build a CNN that aims to solve a regression task: detecting facial keypoints; this skill can be extended to the task of emotion recognition
          </li>
          <li>
           Explore how region-based CNNs and formulations like YOLO lead to faster object recognition
          </li>
          <li>
           Define and train a recurrent neural network (RNN) to process and generate sequences of text
          </li>
          <li>
           Use long short-term memory cells to create an RNN that can produce captions given an image feature vector
          </li>
          <li>
           Train your own algorithmic models to predict and understand visual scenes
          </li>
          <li>
           Use methods like optical flow and Bayesian filters to track an objectâ€™s motion
          </li>
          <li>
           Use SLAM to simultaneously localize an autonomous vehicle and create a map of the landmarks that surround it using only sensor measurements, collected over time
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          To become a better job candidate, dive deeper into the follow concepts, beyond the Nanodegree program.
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Knowledge of or applications in deep learning and neural networks [learning resource - not Udacity]
          </li>
          <li>
           Programming competency in C++  (a useful language for working with hardware). Find C++ programming lessons in the Extracurricular section of your Nanodegree Classroom!
          </li>
          <li>
           Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM)
          </li>
          <li>
           PyTorch and/or TensorFlow
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Although the above is by no means an exhaustive list, taking the time to pick up any of these these technologies will only strengthen your chances of moving forward in an application process.

          3. Could I apply for deep learning jobs?
         </h2>
         <p>
          Companies investing in cutting-edge technologies often look for candidates with both deep learning and computer vision knowledge. For example,
          <a href="http://athelas.com/technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
           Athelas
          </a>
          uses computer vision with deep learning to count white blood cells.
         </p>
         <p>
          A deep learning engineer may be asked to focus on designing and changing the architecture of a CNN or RNN so that it is optimized for training for a variety of tasks, such as voice recognition or generating fake images. Computer vision and deep learning engineers tend to focus on deep learning as it is applied to feature extraction and object recognition with a CNN; some tasks and skills that fall in both realms are pre-processing image data, and training a CNN to detect meaningful visual features. A computer vision &amp; deep learning engineer is expected to work with visual data like images, video, and LiDAR point clouds (laser data).

          <em>
           Tip
          </em>
