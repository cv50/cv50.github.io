00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.139
Let's just go back to our example and see what an amazing thing you've just programmed.

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:06.654
We had a uniform distribution over places,

00:00:06.655 --> 00:00:09.060
each place has a probability of 0.2.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.580
And then you wrote a piece of code that use

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.080
the measurement to turn this prior into a posterior,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.579
in which the probability of

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:24.314
the two red cells for the factor of three larger and the posterior of the green cells.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.400
You've done exactly what I gave you

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.320
intuitively in the beginning as the secret of localization.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.379
You manipulate a probability distribution over

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:35.475
places into a new one by incorporating the measurement.

00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:37.730
In fact, let's go back to our code,

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:40.649
and test in your code whether we get

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.975
a good result when we replace our measurement red by green.

00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:47.730
So, please type green into your measurement variable,

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:51.599
and rerun your code to see if you get the correct result.
