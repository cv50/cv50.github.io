00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.645
Let me begin my story in a world where

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:08.189
a robot resides and let's assume the robot has no clue where it is.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.088
Then we will model this with a function,

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.280
I'm going to draw onto this diagram over here.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:18.210
Where the vertical axis is the probability for any location in

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.850
this world and the horizontal axis

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.429
corresponds to all the places in this one-dimensional world.

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.850
The way I am going to model the robot's current belief about where it might be,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.550
it's confusion is by a uniform function that

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.340
assigns equal weights to every possible place in this world.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.630
There is the state of maximum confusion.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.460
Now to localize the bot has they have some distinctive features,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.259
let's assume there's three different landmarks in the world.

00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:48.704
There's a door over here,

00:00:48.704 --> 00:00:53.034
there's a door over here and a third one way back here.

00:00:53.034 --> 00:00:56.375
And for the sake of the argument let's assume they are all look alike.

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:58.619
They're not distinguishable, but you can

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:02.339
distinguish the door from the none door area from the wall.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.460
Now let's see how the robot can localize itself by assuming it senses,

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:10.649
and it senses that it's standing right next to a door.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.370
All it knows now that is located likely next to a door.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.055
How will this affect our belief?

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:21.155
Here is the critical step for localization.

00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:24.189
If you understand this step you understand localization.

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.719
The measurement of a door transforms our belief function,

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.164
defined over possible locations to a new function.

00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:33.780
It looks very much like this.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.019
For the three locations adjacent to doors,

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:39.810
we now have an increased belief of being

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.189
there whereas all the other locations have a decreased belief.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.280
This is a probability distribution that assigns

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.700
high probability for being next to a door and it's called the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.810
posterior belief with the word posterior means it's after a measurement has been taking.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.579
Now the key aspects of this belief is that we still don't know where we are,

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.170
there's three possible locations and in fact,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.989
it might be that the sensors were

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:09.984
erroneous and we accidentally saw a door where there is none,

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:14.780
there's still a residual probability of being at these places over here,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.240
but these three bumps to get them really express our current best belief of where we are.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:27.344
This representation is absolutely core to probability and to movable localization.

00:02:27.344 --> 00:02:30.275
Now let's assume the robot moves.

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:33.685
Say it moves to the right by a certain distance,

00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:38.115
then we can shift the belief according to the motion.

00:02:38.115 --> 00:02:40.650
Anyway this might look like is about like this.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.685
This pump over here, made it to here.

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:48.305
This guy went over here and this guy over here.

00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:51.540
Obviously this robot it knows it's heading direction,

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:53.764
it's moving to the right in this example.

00:02:53.764 --> 00:02:56.524
But it knows roughly how far it moved.

00:02:56.525 --> 00:02:58.780
Now robot motion is somewhat uncertain,

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.180
we can never be certain where the robot moved.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.645
These things we will be a little bit flatter than these guys over here.

00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:09.520
The process of moving those beliefs to right are essentially called a convolution,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.060
and let's now assume the robot senses again and for the sake of

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.420
the argument let's assume it sees itself right next to a door again,

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.559
so the measurement is the same as before.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.810
Now the most amazing thing happens.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.770
We end up multiplying our belief which is now prior to the second measurement,

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.400
with a function looks very much like this one over here,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.330
which has a peak at each door and outcomes it believes it looks like the following.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.695
There's a couple of minor bumps but the only really big bump is this one over here.

00:03:40.694 --> 00:03:48.219
This one corresponds to this guy over here in the prior and it's the only place in this

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:51.370
prior that really corresponds to the measurement of

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.944
a door whereas all the other places of doors have a low prior belief.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:59.229
As a result this function is really interesting,

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.299
it's a distribution that focuses most of

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.700
its weight under the correct hypothesis of the bot being on

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:10.569
the second door and it provides very little belief to places far away from doors.

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.134
At this point our robot has localized itself.

00:04:14.134 --> 00:04:15.729
If you understood this,

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:19.894
you understand probability and you understand localization.

00:04:19.894 --> 00:04:24.384
Congratulations, you understand probability and localization.

00:04:24.384 --> 00:04:25.560
You might not know yet,

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.699
but that's really a core aspect of

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.610
understanding a whole bunch of things I'm going to teach you in the class today.
