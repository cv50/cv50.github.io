00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
To turn this back into probability distribution,

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:06.324
we will now divide each of these numbers by 0.36,

00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:08.070
but differently, we normalize.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.294
So please, in these five fields,

00:00:10.294 --> 00:00:16.464
enter your result for dividing 0.04 or 0.12 by 0.36,

00:00:16.464 --> 00:00:21.000
and please check that the sum of those truly adds up to 1.
