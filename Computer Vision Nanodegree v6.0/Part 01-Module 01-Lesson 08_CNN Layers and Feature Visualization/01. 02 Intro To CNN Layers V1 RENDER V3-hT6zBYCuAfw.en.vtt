00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.065
You've already seen how to extract color and shape features from an image.

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:05.620
In the examples you've gone through,

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.970
it was up to you to decide what features and filters were the most

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.800
useful for grouping pixel data into similar clusters or classes.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.620
This is similar to how Convolutional Neural Networks

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.660
or CNN's learned to recognize patterns in images.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.653
For example, say we're creating a CNN for image classification,

00:00:22.653 --> 00:00:25.489
this CNN should take in an image as input,

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.079
and output a distribution of class scores

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.109
from which we can get the predicted class for that image.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.719
This CNN is made up of a series of

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.725
layers that learn to extract relevant features out of any image.

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:41.445
The backbone of a CNN is the convolutional layer.

00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:45.130
A convolutional layer applies a series of different image filters,

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.240
also known as convolutional kernels,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.690
to an input image.

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:51.744
The resulting filtered images have different appearances.

00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:55.099
The filters may have extracted features like the edges of objects in

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.060
that image or the colors that distinguish the different classes of images.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.685
As the CNN trains,

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:03.140
it updates the weights that define the image filters

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.305
in this convolutional layer using backpropagation.

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:09.830
The end result is a classifier with convolutional layers that have

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.730
learned to filter images to extract distinguishing features.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.245
In the next section,

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:19.660
we'll learn how convolutional neural networks learn to extract features from images,

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.899
go over the types of layers that make up a complete convolutional neural network,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.260
and learn some techniques for visualizing the inner workings of a CNN.
