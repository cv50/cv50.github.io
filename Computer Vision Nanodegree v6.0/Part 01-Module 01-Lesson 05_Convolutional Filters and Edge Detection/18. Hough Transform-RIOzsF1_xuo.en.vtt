00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.339
The simplest boundary you can detect is a line,

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.419
and more complex boundaries are often made up of several lines.

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:11.134
For example, in document or photo scanning,

00:00:11.134 --> 00:00:13.115
documents are typically rectangular,

00:00:13.115 --> 00:00:16.829
and so their boundary can be thought of as four lines placed together.

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.980
And when you do edge detection,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.839
you'll find that edges when pieced together form longer line segments and shapes.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.039
We can think of representing any line as a function of space.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.810
In image space, the equation that represents a line is y=m x + b,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.130
where m is the slope of the line and B is how far it shifted up or down.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.000
And here M_0 and B_0 are just specific constant values.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.945
A useful transformation is moving

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:49.534
this line representation from image space to Hough space,

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:51.849
also called parameter space.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.030
The Hough transform converts data points from image space to Hough space,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.670
and represents a line in the simplest way.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.864
As a point at the coordinate m_0 b_0,

00:01:01.863 --> 00:01:06.409
which are the same M and B from the line equation y=m x + b.

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.079
Multiple lines in image space can be

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.635
represented by multiple m and b coordinates in Hough space.

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:16.880
And patterns in Hough space can help us identify lines or other shapes.

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:19.625
You can think about this the other way round too.

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:25.614
For example, look at these two lines in Hough space that intersect at the point m_0, b_0.

00:01:25.614 --> 00:01:30.098
What do you think this intersection point looks like in image space?

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:34.609
It's the line with the equation y = m_0 x + b_0.

00:01:34.608 --> 00:01:37.219
And if we have a line made of mini segments or

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.549
points close to the same line equation in image space,

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.539
this turns into many intersecting lines in Hough space.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.060
Imagine this line as part of an edge detected

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.165
image where a line just has some small discontinuities in it.

00:01:51.165 --> 00:01:54.020
Our strategy then for finding continuous lines in

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:58.125
an image is to look at intersection points in Hough space.

00:01:58.125 --> 00:01:59.944
This is a simplified example,

00:01:59.944 --> 00:02:02.869
and you may have thought about the case of a line straight up and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.060
down which technically has an infinite slope.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.344
So a better way to transform image space

00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:11.305
is by turning Hough space into polar coordinates.

00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:13.713
So instead of m and b, we have rho,

00:02:13.713 --> 00:02:17.194
which is the distance of the line from the origin and theta,

00:02:17.194 --> 00:02:20.375
which is the angle from the horizontal axis.

00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:23.990
Now, a fragmented line or points that fall in a line can be

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.070
identified in Hough space as the intersection of sinusoids.

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.680
Now, let's test your knowledge of Hough space then walk

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.689
through how to use this transform to identify lines.
