00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
Congratulations. Semantic segmentation is

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.839
the cutting edge of perception in autonomous vehicles and beyond.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.814
This is a tremendous skill to demonstrate to employers and to use on the job.

00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:13.199
Even better, you can build on this knowledge to

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.429
construct faster and more powerful segmentation networks.

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:18.475
In the next lesson,

00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:20.875
you'll learn about inference optimizations,

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:24.309
which accelerate the deployed model in production.

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:29.000
You see, even after training there's still a lot we can do to improve performance.
