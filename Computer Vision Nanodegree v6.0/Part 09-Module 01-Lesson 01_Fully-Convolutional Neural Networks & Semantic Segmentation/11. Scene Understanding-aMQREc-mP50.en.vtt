00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.455
One approach to scene understanding is to train multiple decoders.

00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:07.490
Each decoder trains on a separate task.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.234
We might have one decoder for segmentation and another for depth measurement.

00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:14.849
This way we can have a single network which not only

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.899
predicts the class of a pixel but additionally how far away it is.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:23.309
You can imagine using this information to reconstruct a rich 3D scene,

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:25.454
kind of like how we human do.

00:00:25.454 --> 00:00:28.794
This is in fact, the next step to visual perception.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:31.380
For now though, we'll keep things relatively

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:34.350
simple focused just on semantic segmentation.
