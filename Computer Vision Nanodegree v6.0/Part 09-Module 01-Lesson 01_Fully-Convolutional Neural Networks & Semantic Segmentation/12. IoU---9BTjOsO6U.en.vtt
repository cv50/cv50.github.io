00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
IOU, not the monetary kind,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.919
is Intersection Over Union Metric,

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:10.219
commonly used to measure the performance of a model on the semantic segmentation task.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.960
It is literally just the intersection set divided by the union set.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.230
Intersection of two sets is an AND operation.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.071
If it exists in both sets,

00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:23.520
then we put it into the intersection set.

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.335
For each class, the intersection is defined as the number of pixels that are both

00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:34.439
truly part of that class and are classified as part of that class by the network.

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:38.204
Union of the two set is a OR operation.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:41.655
If it exists in at least one of the two sets,

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:43.590
then we put it into the union set.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.390
The union is defined as the number of pixels that are truly part of that class

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.155
plus the number of pixels that are classified as part of that class by the network.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:59.549
So, the intersection set should always be smaller or equal to the union set.

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:03.884
The ratio then tell us the overall performance per pixel, per class.

00:01:03.884 --> 00:01:06.939
Since this intersection set is divided by the union set,

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.120
the ratio will always be less than or equal to one.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.340
We can go even further and calculate the mean IOU for a network,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.540
which is just the average of all the IOU for all the classes.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.015
This gives you an idea of how well it handles

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:24.329
all the different classifications for every single pixel.

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:29.299
Intensive flow we can use matrix mean IOU function and call it directly.
