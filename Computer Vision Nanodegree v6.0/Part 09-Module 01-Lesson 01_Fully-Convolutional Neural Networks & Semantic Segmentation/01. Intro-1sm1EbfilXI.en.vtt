00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.444
Welcome to advanced deep learning.

00:00:02.444 --> 00:00:06.964
You'll be learning about cutting edge deep neural networks with Kelvin Lwin,

00:00:06.964 --> 00:00:09.660
the lead Autonomous Vehicle Instructor in NVIDIA.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.890
In this module, we will cover fully convolutional networks,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.539
object detection, semantics segmentation and inference optimizations.

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.019
Finally, you'll apply these concepts and techniques to train and supervise

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.759
semantic segmentation network and test your result on automotive videos.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.980
The networks and techniques you'll be studying are at

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.974
the leading edge of research into deep learning for autonomous driving.

00:00:33.973 --> 00:00:36.819
It is so cool to be able to work with Kelvin on this

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.240
and we hope you're excited to be at the forefront of Automotive Research.
