00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
The third special technique that fully

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.175
convolution on networks use is the skip connection.

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:09.300
One effect of convolutions or encoding in general is you narrow down

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.475
the scope by looking closely at some picture and lose the bigger picture as a result.

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:19.405
So even if we were to decode the output of the encoder back to the original image size,

00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:21.458
some information has been lost.

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:25.629
Skip connections are a way of retaining the information easily.

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:27.900
The way skip connection work is by connecting

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.020
the output of one layer to a non-adjacent layer.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.650
Here, the output of the pooling layer from the encoders combine with

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.180
the current layers output using the element-wise addition operation.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.260
The result is bent into the next layer.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.300
These skip connections allow the network to use information from multiple resolutions.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.630
As a result, the network is able to make more precise segmentation decisions.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.970
This is empirically shown in the following comparison

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.400
between the FCN-8 architecture which has

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.430
two skip connections and the FCN-32 architecture which has zero skip connections.
