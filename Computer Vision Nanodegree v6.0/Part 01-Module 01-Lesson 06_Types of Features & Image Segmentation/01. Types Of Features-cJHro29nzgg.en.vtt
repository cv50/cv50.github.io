00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.690
Let's look at this image of a mountain.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.154
This is Mt. Rainier in Washington state.

00:00:06.155 --> 00:00:10.175
Most features on this and any other image fall into one

00:00:10.175 --> 00:00:14.420
of three categories: edges, corners, and blobs.

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:17.012
Edges we're already very familiar with,

00:00:17.013 --> 00:00:21.175
they're are just areas in an image where the intensity abruptly changes.

00:00:21.175 --> 00:00:24.469
Also known as areas that have a high intensity gradient.

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:26.629
Corners are at the intersection of

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:30.890
two edges and form what looks like a corner or a sharp point.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.369
And the blobs are region based features that may include areas of

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:39.084
extreme highs or lows in intensity or areas of a unique texture.

00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:43.125
We'll be most interested in detecting corners because they're

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:46.174
the most repeatable feature which means that they're

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:50.449
easy to recognize given two or more images of the same scene.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.480
As a simple example let's look at this image of

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:58.279
a Mondrian painting and let's look at these three patches: patch A,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.820
B, and C. Given these three patches

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.344
can you tell me what rectangular area they match with on this image?

00:01:06.344 --> 00:01:10.370
Patch A is just a single patch of color and it

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.475
matches with a lot of areas like this all around the rectangle.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:18.394
So this is a bad feature because it isn't unique.

00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:21.259
Patch B is an edge we know because of

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.855
its orientation that it matches with an edge at the bottom of the red rectangle.

00:01:25.855 --> 00:01:31.540
But we can still move this edge to the left and right and it would still be a match.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.120
We can only approximate where this edge appears on this image.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.125
It's very hard to get the exact location.

00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:40.340
Patch C is a corner.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.609
It actually contains two corners and

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:48.170
its location is easily identified as the bottom right.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.230
This is because a corner represents a point where two edges change.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.665
And if we move either of those up or down

00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:58.070
the corner patch will not match exactly with that area.

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:04.319
So corners are easiest to match and make good features because they are so unique.

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.299
Next let's see a more complex example of where corners are useful for

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.000
identifying points on an object and get some practice coding a corner detector.
