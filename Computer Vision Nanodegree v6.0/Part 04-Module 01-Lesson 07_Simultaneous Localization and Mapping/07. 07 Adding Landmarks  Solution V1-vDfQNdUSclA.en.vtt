00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
And here's the answer. Obviously, X1 minus L0 is minus

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.705
nine because L0 minus X1 is a measurement of plus nine.

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:11.245
So let's add this in.

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:15.214
We had one over here on the main diagonal, one.

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:19.210
We subtract one off the main diagonal just like before,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.025
simple pattern, and then the nine over here goes back to zero,

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:24.604
but to nine over here.

00:00:24.605 --> 00:00:27.890
I hope this makes perfect sense to you.
