00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.710
Hi students. I am back to teach you a bit about SLAM.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.000
There was a request,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.109
a popular request actually in email and discussion forum.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.429
So SLAM is a method for mapping.

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.995
It's short for simultaneous localization and mapping.

00:00:13.994 --> 00:00:17.059
And some of this might show up and the final exam,

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:19.094
so do pay attention.

00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:22.964
Mapping is all about building maps of the environment.

00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:25.484
You might remember in the localization classes,

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:27.289
we assume the map was given.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.149
One of my big passions in my life has been to understand how to

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.019
make a robot make these maps like this map over here,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.000
which is a 3D map of

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.244
an abandoned underground coal mine in Pennsylvania near Carnegie Mellon University.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.659
Over the past 10 years or so,

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.259
I've worked on a number of different methods for building maps that

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:54.739
are quite sophisticated like this particular pillar method over here that you can see.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.079
All these methods have in common that we build a model of the environment while also

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.364
addressing the fact that the robot itself accrues uncertainty valid moves.

00:01:03.365 --> 00:01:05.189
So in this example here,

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.049
the loop is being closed.

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.969
You can see how our mapping technology is able to accommodate this and

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:17.385
find a consistent map despite the fact that the robot drifted along the way.

00:01:17.385 --> 00:01:20.940
So the key insights in building maps is that the robot

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.234
itself might lose track of where it is by virtue of its motion uncertainty.

00:01:26.234 --> 00:01:29.310
You accommodated this in localization by using

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.530
existing map but now we don't have an existing map, we're building the map.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.650
That's why SLAM comes into play.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.280
SLAM doesn't stand for slamming a robot.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.674
What it really means is simultaneous localization and mapping.

00:01:42.674 --> 00:01:44.310
This is a big,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.879
big, big research field.

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:49.810
Most of my AI book is about this technology.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.810
And today, I want to show you my favorite method called GRAPH SLAM,

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.420
which is also by far the easiest method to understand.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.420
We will reduce the mapping problem to a couple of

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.400
very intuitive additions into a big matrix and a vector, and that's it.
