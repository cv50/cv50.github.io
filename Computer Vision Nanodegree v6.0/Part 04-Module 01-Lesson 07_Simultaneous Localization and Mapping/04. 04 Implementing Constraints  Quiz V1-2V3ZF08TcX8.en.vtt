00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.875
What we do is we make a matrix and also a vector.

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:04.700
And we label the matrix,

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.089
which is quadratic with all the poses and all the landmarks.

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:13.230
Here we assume the landmarks are distinguishable and every time we make an observation,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.925
say between two poses,

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:18.330
they become little additions locally in

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.474
the four elements in the matrix defined over those poses.

00:00:21.475 --> 00:00:25.365
For example, if the robot moves from x_0 to x_1.

00:00:25.364 --> 00:00:30.509
We therefore believe x_1 should be the same as x_0 say plus five.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.420
The way we enter this into the matrix is in two ways.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.070
First, 1 x_0, minus 1 x_1,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.625
add it together should be minus five.

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:46.960
We look on the equation here x_0 minus x_1 equals minus 5.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.160
These are added into the matrix that starts with zero

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.759
everywhere and it's a constraint that relates x_0,

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:57.149
x_1 by minus 5, it's that simple.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.649
Secondly, we do the same with x_1 as positive,

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.954
so we add one over here and for that,

00:01:02.954 --> 00:01:05.329
x_1 minus x_0 equals five.

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.439
You put five here and a minus one over here.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:14.804
Put differently the motion constraint that relates x_0 to x_1 by the motion of five,

00:01:14.805 --> 00:01:17.925
has modified incrementally by adding values,

00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:21.625
the matrix for all elements that fall between x_0 and x_1.

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:25.504
We basically wrote that constraint twice in both cases,

00:01:25.504 --> 00:01:28.640
we make sure that the diagonal element was positive and the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.245
viewer the correspondents off-diagonal element as a negative value.

00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:34.520
We added the corresponding value on the right side.

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:36.750
Let me ask you a question,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.334
suppose we know we go from x_1 to x_2 and whereas the motion over here was plus five.

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:46.159
Now, it's minus 4, so we moving back in the opposite direction.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.004
What will be the new value as for the matrix over here?

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:50.875
I'll give you a hint.

00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:55.000
They only affect values that occur in the region between x_1,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.185
x_2 and over here,

00:01:57.185 --> 00:02:00.379
and remember these are additive
