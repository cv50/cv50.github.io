00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
The answer is right over here.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.009
Why? If our current starting point is the point over here,

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.064
for which we know the location is one,

00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:12.474
and the velocity is one,

00:00:12.474 --> 00:00:14.879
and we predict one time step in the future.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.484
Then for that prediction,

00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:18.600
we know the location will be two,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.960
and the velocity might be liberal uncertain,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.089
but it stays about the same.

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.719
So we end up with a point over here. Let's do this again.
