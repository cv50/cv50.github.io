00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.004
To explain how this works,

00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:06.779
I have to talk about high-dimensional Gaussians.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.589
These are often called Multivariate Gaussians.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:19.204
The mean is now a vector with one element for each of the dimensions.

00:00:19.204 --> 00:00:24.324
The variance square is replaced by what's called a covariance and it's a matrix

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:30.329
with D rows and D columns if the dimensionality of the estimator is D,

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.339
and the formula is something you have to get used to.

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:37.779
I'm writing it out for you,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.800
but you'll never get to see this again.

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:44.519
Pay the tooth even I have to look up the formula for this class,

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.260
so I don't have it in my head and please don't get confused.

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:51.199
Let me explain it to you more intuitively.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.290
Here's a two-dimensional space.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.704
A two-dimensional Gaussian is defined over that space

00:00:58.704 --> 00:01:04.939
and it is possible to draw the contour lines of the Gaussian that might look like this.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.579
The mean of this Gaussian is this x_0,

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.875
y_0 pair and the covariance now

00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:16.465
defines the spread of the Gaussian as indicated by these contour lines.

00:01:16.465 --> 00:01:20.885
A Gaussian with small amounts of uncertainty might look like this.

00:01:20.885 --> 00:01:24.070
It may be possible to have a fairly small uncertainty in

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:27.364
one dimension but a huge uncertainty in the other.

00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:31.924
The uncertainty in the x dimension is small and the y dimension is large,

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:35.629
and when the Gaussian is tilted as shown over here,

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:38.379
then the uncertainty of x and y is correlated which

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:42.625
means if I get information about x that actually sits over here,

00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:47.435
they would make me believe that y probably sits somewhere over here.

00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:49.870
That's called correlation.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.060
I can explain to you the entire effect of estimating velocity and using

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.310
it in filtering using Gaussians like this and it becomes really simple.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.465
The problem I'm going to choose is a one-dimensional motion example.

00:02:04.465 --> 00:02:07.075
Let's assume at t equals 1,

00:02:07.075 --> 00:02:08.870
we see our options over here,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.069
at t equals 2 right over here,

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.164
at t equals 3 over here,

00:02:13.164 --> 00:02:17.719
then you would assume that at t equals 4,

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:19.764
the object sits over here.

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:22.899
And the reason why you would assume this is even

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.900
though we just seen these different discrete locations,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.960
you can infer from where there's actually velocity that drives

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.120
the object to the right side to the point over here.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.409
Now, how does the Kalman Filter addresses?

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.840
This is the true beauty of the Kalman filter
