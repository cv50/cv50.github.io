00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.259
Now you've seen that corners are good unique features

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.410
that can help identify certain points on an object.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.349
And this is a great example of how object structure and

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.724
image gradients can be useful in feature recognition.

00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:17.655
But if we're interested not only in feature points like corners,

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:19.734
but in whole object detection,

00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:24.809
we have to look at distinct sets of features often called "feature vectors."

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:27.359
And in fact, if you look at the direction of

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.405
multiple gradients around the center point in an image,

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:32.535
you can get a feature vector that makes for

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:35.794
a robust representation of the shape of an object.

00:00:35.795 --> 00:00:40.045
Let's look at a few simple examples to better understand this idea.

00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:45.660
Take this trapezoid and its corresponding gradient which is just an edge detected image.

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.109
If we break this image up into a grid of cells and look at

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:53.819
the direction of the gradient in each cell with respect to the center of the trapezoid,

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:57.685
we can then flatten this data and create a 1D array.

00:00:57.685 --> 00:00:59.480
This is a feature vector,

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.929
and in this case it's a vector of gradient directions.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.569
We can do the same thing for other shapes like this circle taking

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:10.790
the gradient and calculating the direction of the gradient in each grid cell,

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.189
and we get a different feature vector for each shape.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.090
These two feature vectors exactly represent these two shapes,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.454
but ideally to accurately identify any circle or

00:01:21.454 --> 00:01:25.200
trapezoid at different sizes or from different perspectives,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.430
these vectors should allow for enough flexibility to detect some variation

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.500
in these shapes while remaining distinct

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.680
enough to be able to distinguish different shapes.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.790
Next, we'll talk about

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.450
some common feature detection methods that allow for this flexibility,

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.228
and use patterns in image gradients to recognize different objects.
