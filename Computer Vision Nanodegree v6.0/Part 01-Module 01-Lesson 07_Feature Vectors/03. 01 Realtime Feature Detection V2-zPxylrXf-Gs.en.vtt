00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.509
Having a fast Object Recognition Algorithm

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.195
is essential for many computer vision applications,

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:13.945
such as an augmented reality,

00:00:13.945 --> 00:00:16.289
robotics and self-driving cars.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.980
These kinds of applications need to respond to input video streams in real time,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.615
and so time is critical.

00:00:22.614 --> 00:00:24.349
A self-driving car for example,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.400
needs to constantly check whether another cars in front of it,

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.964
so that it can decide whether to slow down, brake, or accelerate.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:35.049
Similarly, augmented reality applications rely on a live view of

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:39.174
the real world to decide where to place virtual elements in a given scene.

00:00:39.174 --> 00:00:41.489
For these real-time applications to work,

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.920
they need to be able to identify the objects in their field of view,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.954
in a fast and efficient manner.

00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:48.960
This is where ORB comes in.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.880
The ORB algorithm is used to quickly create feature vectors of key points in an image.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.310
These feature vectors can then be used to identify objects in images.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.600
In this lesson, we'll look at the details of how the ORB algorithm works.
