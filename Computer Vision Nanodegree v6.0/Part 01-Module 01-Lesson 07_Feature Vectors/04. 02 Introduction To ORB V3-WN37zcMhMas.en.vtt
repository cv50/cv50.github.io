00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.495
Orb, stands for Oriented Fast and Rotated Brief.

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:08.175
Fast and brief, are a feature detection in a vector creation algorithm respectively.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:11.970
And we'll get into the math behind each of these algorithms in the next couple of videos.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.350
Orb, starts by finding special regions in an image called key points.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.705
In general, you can think of a key point as

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:22.439
a small region in an image that's particularly distinctive.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.885
An example is Corners,

00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:26.620
where the pixel values sharply change from light to dark.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.950
Here we see an example of orb generated key points in this image of a cat.

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.994
We see points around the cat's eyes and at the edges of its facial features.

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:37.659
Once the key points in the image had been located,

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:42.194
orb then calculates a corresponding feature vector for each key point.

00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:47.005
The orb algorithm creates feature vectors that only contain ones and zeros.

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:50.195
For this reason, they're called the binary feature vectors.

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:53.079
The sequence of ones and zeros varies according to

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.769
what a specific key point and its surrounding pixel area look like.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.270
The vector represents the patterns of intensity around a key point.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.380
So, multiple feature vectors can be used to identify a larger area,

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.689
and even a specific object in an image.

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.209
Orb, is not only incredibly fast,

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:11.949
but it's also impervious to noise illumination,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.865
and image transformations such as rotations.

00:01:14.864 --> 00:01:18.329
I mentioned that orb, stands for Oriented fast and Rotated Brief.

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:24.679
Next, we'll take a closer look at how the fast and brief algorithms work.
