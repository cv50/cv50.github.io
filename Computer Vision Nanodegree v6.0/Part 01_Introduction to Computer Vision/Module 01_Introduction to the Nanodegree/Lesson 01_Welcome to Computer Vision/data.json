Bee's eyes have really low resolution, so they’re not so great at recognizing things from a distance, but they’re very sensitive to motion, which is essential while flying fast! \n\n\nThere are a variety of vision systems, each with their own strengths, and this is something to keep in mind when we start building and designing systems to perform specific visual tasks in future lessons.\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about compound eyes, take a look at [this reference](https://www.reference.com/science/compound-eyes-362b8e2642846797#). \n",

So those techniques that you will learn, will be useful for any data, that has what we call, “spatial coherency”.\n\nAnd spatially coherent data can be thought of as any data that predictably varies over space, like sound, for example. If you hear sound from a speaker close up it will sound very loud, but the farther you get away, the softer the sound will get. And so the volume of a sound can give you spatial information! \n",
