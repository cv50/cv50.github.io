Now that you've seen a few examples of pattern recognition in action,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.150
I hope you're excited to learn more about the math and

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.875
programming concepts that these applications rely on.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.970
One thing I love about computer vision is how widely it's applied from

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.400
applications like medical diagnostics to cool computer graphics.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.449
It's a far-reaching and beautiful field.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.879
