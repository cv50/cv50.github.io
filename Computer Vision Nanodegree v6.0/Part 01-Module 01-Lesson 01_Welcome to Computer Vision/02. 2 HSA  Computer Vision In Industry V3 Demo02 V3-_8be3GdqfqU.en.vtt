00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.669
You might be wondering where computer vision fits in the world of AI.

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.330
What kind of applications use computer vision?

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.759
Well, computer vision is all about recognizing

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.379
visual patterns and these patterns are everywhere.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.320
In fact, many of us have phones or

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.745
other devices that use computer vision on a daily basis.

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:20.880
Computer vision is used to focus a camera and apply filters to images.

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:23.640
And deep learning models can even identify faces and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.925
images and categorize personal images and video.

00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:31.484
Computer vision is also widely used in state of the art medical technology.

00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:36.195
Some applications can even learn to recognize cancerous tissue by looking at lots of

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:38.039
image data and learning the patterns that

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.964
distinguish cancerous tissue from healthy tissue.

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:46.085
Another example of an AI system is when we're working on at Udacity, a self-driving car.

00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:48.990
The car sees the world through cameras and sensors,

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.440
and then uses that input to safely navigate roads by itself.

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:55.229
Computer vision is used to analyze camera images

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.244
and to identify objects like other cars or pedestrians.

00:00:58.244 --> 00:01:00.719
It's also used to recognize where the car is on

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.600
the road and in the world based on the car's surroundings.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.349
So, here computer vision is not only used to identify objects,

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:10.364
it's also used to build up a physical model of the world.

00:01:10.364 --> 00:01:13.709
These are just a few impact for applications of computer vision.

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:16.890
Next, I'll talk about the skills you'll be learning in this course that

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.129
will allow you to build computer vision applications of your own.
