00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.089
Welcome to the computer vision nanodegree program.

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:10.949
I'm Suzanne Camacho, an expert in computer vision,

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:12.854
and the curriculum lead for this program.

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:14.919
Computer vision is how machines,

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.309
like smartphones or robotic systems,

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:19.664
visually perceive the world and respond to it.

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:21.919
It's modeled after human vision.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.710
For example, I can look around this room and observe my surroundings.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.464
I noticed this desk in front of me,

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:28.800
the mug on the desk,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.679
and the floor beneath me and I can describe what's in this room

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.085
and even where I am in relation to all these objects.

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:37.995
This is similar to how a robot might see the world.

00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:41.429
A robot can gather data through cameras and other sensors,

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:43.109
and then use that input to identify

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.310
different objects and safely move through its environment.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.450
In this course, will learn all about

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.905
computer vision techniques that are used to analyze images and spatial information.

00:00:52.905 --> 00:00:56.939
We'll also talk about deep learning and how it's used in computer vision tasks

00:00:56.939 --> 00:01:01.229
to give machines a way to learn from data and recognize patterns in images.

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:03.719
Before we jump into learning encoding,

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.799
I'll first go over some details about where computer vision is used in industry,

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.299
and what specific skills you'll be learning in this course.
