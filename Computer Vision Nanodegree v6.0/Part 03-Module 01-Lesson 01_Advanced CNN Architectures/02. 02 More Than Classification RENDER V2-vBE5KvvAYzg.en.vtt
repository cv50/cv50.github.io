00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
In this lesson we'll talk about a few different types of

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.455
CNN architectures that can do more than single image classification.

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:12.210
First we'll talk about classifying one object in an image and localizing it,

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.850
which means finding its location in the image.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.914
This is typically done by placing a bounding box around the object.

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:22.064
Finding the location of an object in an image and

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:25.245
more generally being able to analyze an image by breaking it

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:28.289
up into smaller bounded regions is the key to

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.234
creating a model that can classify multiple objects in an image.

00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:35.769
We'll build up to learning about region-based CNN's like

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.410
the faster R-CNN model which analyzes different cropped areas of a single input image,

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:46.569
decides which regions correspond to objects and then performs classification as usual.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.505
This is the kind of architecture that's used in cutting edge applications,

00:00:50.505 --> 00:00:53.589
from medical diagnostic tools to autonomous vehicles.

00:00:53.588 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm really excited to show you how they work.
