00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.184
You've really learned a lot about the evolution of CNN architectures in this lesson,

00:00:05.184 --> 00:00:10.390
especially about how to detect multiple objects in an image using region proposals.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.019
As we mentioned at the start,

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.899
simple image classification problems are really the most basic application for CNNs.

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:19.879
And if we're aiming to reach levels of human understanding,

00:00:19.879 --> 00:00:23.369
we have to add complexity to these networks so that they're able to

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.164
recognize multiple objects and their relations to one another.

00:00:27.164 --> 00:00:29.820
You may also be wondering if there's a way to perform

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.810
object recognition without region proposals like this, and there is.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.325
There's a whole other family of

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:38.699
object detection networks that don't use region proposals.

00:00:38.698 --> 00:00:40.210
One of these is YOLO,

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.395
which stands for you only look once,

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:43.995
and another is SSD,

00:00:43.994 --> 00:00:45.689
or single shot detection.

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:47.700
These both came out around the same time,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.790
and in the next lesson you'll learn all about YOLO and get a chance

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.359
to work with a code implementation of a YOLO Detection Network.
