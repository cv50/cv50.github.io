00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
One of the problems with

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.819
this grid-based method for object detection is that a trained CNN,

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.775
when faced with a new test image will often produce

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:13.300
multiple grid cell vectors that are all trying to detect the same object.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.260
This means lots of output vectors that all contain

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.475
slightly different bounding boxes for the same object.

00:00:19.475 --> 00:00:23.474
To account for this, we use a technique called non-maximal suppression

00:00:23.474 --> 00:00:27.945
which tries to find the bounding box that best matches an object in an image.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:31.960
Next, we'll learn how it finds the best box in a group.
