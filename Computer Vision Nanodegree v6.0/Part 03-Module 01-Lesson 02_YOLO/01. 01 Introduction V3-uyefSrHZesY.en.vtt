00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.615
Now you've learned about

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:08.400
a number of region-based methods for

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.445
recognizing and locating multiple objects in a scene.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:14.410
Architectures like faster R-CNN are accurate,

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.629
but the model itself is quite complex,

00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:20.355
with multiple outputs that are each a potential source of error.

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:23.935
Once trained they're still not fast enough to run in real time.

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:28.169
In this lesson we'll be learning about YOLO which stands for You Only Look Once,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.840
and it's a real-time object detection algorithm,

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.500
that avoid spending too much time on generating region proposals.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.564
Instead of locating objects perfectly,

00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:39.429
it prioritizes speed and recognition.

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.240
Let's see an example of YOLO in action.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.800
Consider a self-driving car that sees this image of a street.

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:48.379
It's essential for a self-driving car to be able to

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.980
detect the location of objects all around it,

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:53.674
such as pedestrians cars, and traffic lights.

00:00:53.674 --> 00:00:57.259
On top of that, this detection has to happen in near real time,

00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:00.155
so that the car can safely navigate the street.

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:03.560
The card doesn't always need to know what all these objects are?

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.594
It mostly needs to know not to crash into them but it does need to recognize

00:01:07.594 --> 00:01:09.739
traffic lights bikes and pedestrians

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:12.464
to be able to correctly follow the rules of the road.

00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:18.020
In this image we've used the YOLO algorithm to locate and classify different objects,

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:23.009
there's a bounding box that locates each object and a corresponding class label.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.400
In the next videos we'll learn the details of how the YOLO algorithm works.
