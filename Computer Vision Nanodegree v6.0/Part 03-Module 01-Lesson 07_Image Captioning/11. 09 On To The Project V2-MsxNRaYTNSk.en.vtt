00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
Now, that you've learned about the structure of an automatic captioning system,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.110
your next task will be to apply what you've

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.634
learned to build and train your own captioning network.

00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:14.330
You'll be provided with some data pre-processing steps,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.730
and your main tasks will be about deciding how to train the RNN portion of the model.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.660
Keep in mind the type and shape of the input that each LSTM cell expect to see,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.780
and what shape the output takes,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.039
and use that information to inform your decisions about optimization and hyperparameters.

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:40.200
We also encourage you to look at and learn from existing academic papers on this subject.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.475
This project should really give you a chance to demonstrate

00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:47.920
your knowledge of deep learning architectures. So good luck.
