00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.679
So before we're done with localization,

00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:03.419
I'd like to talk about robot motion.

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.279
Suppose we have a distribution over those cells,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.105
such as this one: a ninth,

00:00:08.105 --> 00:00:10.035
a third, a third, a ninth, a ninth.

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:12.664
And even though we don't know where the robot is,

00:00:12.664 --> 00:00:15.479
the robot moves, and it moves to the right.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.480
In fact, the way we're going to program is that we assume the world cyclic.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.199
So if it drops off the rightmost cell,

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.344
and finds itself on the leftmost cell.

00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:26.579
Suppose we know for a fact the robot moved

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.184
exactly one grid cell to the right including the cyclic motion.

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:33.924
Can you tell me for all these five values

00:00:33.924 --> 00:00:37.119
what the posterior probability is after that motion?
