00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
So, here's a question for you that is somewhat involved,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.669
and I either want to check your intuition.

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:08.310
Suppose we have five grid cells as before,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.560
with an initial distribution that assigns

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.554
one to the first grid cell and zero to all of the other ones,

00:00:13.554 --> 00:00:15.709
let's assume we do U equals one,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.365
which means with 0.8 chance in each action,

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:21.394
we transition one to the right.

00:00:21.394 --> 00:00:25.679
With 0.1 chance, we don't move at all and with 0.1 chance again,

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.640
we skip and move two steps and again,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.910
let's assume the world is cyclic.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.045
Every time I fall off on the right side,

00:00:31.045 --> 00:00:33.289
I find myself back on the left side.

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:35.700
The question is, suppose I have

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.505
an infinitely many motion steps then I

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:41.820
actually get a what's called the limit distribution.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.270
So what's going to happen to my robot if it never senses but executes the action,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.020
one will go one to the right on our little cyclic environment forever?

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:00.560
What will be the so-called limit or stationary distribution B in the very end?
