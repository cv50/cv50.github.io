00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.819
So, let's talk about inaccurate robot motion.

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:06.074
We're again given five grid cells and let's assume

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:10.210
a robot executes its action with high probability correctly,

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.505
say 0.80 over the 0.1 chance,

00:00:13.505 --> 00:00:17.339
it finds itself short of the intended action and get another

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:21.550
1.1 probability it finds itself overshooting its target.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.335
You can define the same for other U values,

00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:26.000
say U equals one,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.870
then with 0.8 chance,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.500
it would end up over here,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.704
0.1 it stays in the same element.

00:00:31.704 --> 00:00:35.674
In 0.1, it hops two elements ahead.

00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:38.679
Now, this is a model of inaccurate robot motion.

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:43.539
This robot attempts to go U grid cells but occasionally falls

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.460
short of its goal or overshoots and that's a more common case robots as they

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.049
move accrue uncertainty and it's really important to model this because this is

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:58.829
the primary reason why localization is hard because robots are not very accurate.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.359
We now are going to look into this first,

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:02.810
for the mathematical side.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.640
I will be giving you a prior distribution and we're going to be using the value U equals

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.765
two and for the motion model that shifts the robots exactly two steps,

00:01:12.765 --> 00:01:16.379
we believe there's a 0.8 chance if we assign a

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:21.629
0.1 to the cases where the robot over undershoots by exactly one.

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:28.109
That's kind of written by this formula over here where the two gets a 0.8 probability,

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:31.665
the one and three end up with 0.1 probability.

00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:36.390
What I ask you now for the initial distribution that I'm writing up here,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.359
can you give me the distribution after the motion.
