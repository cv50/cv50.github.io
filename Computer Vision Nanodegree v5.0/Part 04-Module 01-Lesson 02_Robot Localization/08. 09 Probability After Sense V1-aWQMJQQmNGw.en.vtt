00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
So, let's look at the measurement of

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:08.445
this robot in his world with five different grid cells x_1 to x_5.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:12.530
Let's assume two of those cells are colored red,

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.934
whereas the other three are green.

00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:21.060
As before, we assign uniform probability to each cell of 0.2,

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:24.934
and our robot is now allowed to sense,

00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:28.904
and what it sees is a red color.

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:32.960
How will this affect my belief over different places?

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.274
Obviously, the ones for x_2 and x_3 should go up,

00:00:36.274 --> 00:00:38.119
and the ones for x_1,

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:39.854
x_4, and x_5 should go down.

00:00:39.854 --> 00:00:44.069
So, I'm going to tell you how to incorporate this measurement

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.659
into our belief with a very simple rule, a product.

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.654
Any cell where the color is correct,

00:00:51.655 --> 00:00:53.335
any of the red cells,

00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:57.304
we multiply it with a relatively large number,

00:00:57.304 --> 00:01:04.379
say 0.6, that feels small but as we'll see later is actually a large number.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.125
Whereas all the green cells will be multiplied with 0.2,

00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:14.480
we look at the ratio of those that it seems about three

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.314
times as likely to be in the red cell than it is to be in the green cell,

00:01:19.314 --> 00:01:22.605
because 0.6 is three times larger than 0.2.

00:01:22.605 --> 00:01:24.510
Let us do the multiplication.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.405
For each of those five cells,

00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:29.180
can you tell me what the result would be

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.180
multiplying in the measurement in the way I've stated.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.510
So, please for these five boxes, fill out the number.
