00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.420
I'm Danny Shapiro. I'm the senior director of automotive at NVIDIA.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.335
NVIDIA is a technology company that's developed a lot of different computing platforms.

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:19.610
Specifically, we've developed an AI supercomputer

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.830
for self-driving vehicles, whether the cars,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.710
shuttles, trucks, or any kinds of other vehicles

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.590
that we'll soon see on our roads and maybe even in the skies above us.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.116
So NVIDIA is not making cars,

00:00:32.116 --> 00:00:37.190
but NVIDIA has its own fleet of self-driving test vehicles,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.625
and we've dubbed it BB8,

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:42.450
as a robotic, an advanced robotic vehicle,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.110
and we're testing those here on the streets in California,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.420
in New Jersey, in Germany as well.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.360
We've been working with the auto industry for almost two decades now.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.100
In fact, every car, truck, plane,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.980
or other mode of transportation and

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:08.855
even consumer goods are designed on NVIDIA graphics hardware and software systems.

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:10.085
About a decade ago,

00:01:10.085 --> 00:01:12.500
we started bringing our technology into the car.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.520
We started working on infotainment systems and digital cockpits and head up displays.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.220
More recently though our technology because of the role we're playing in

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.795
artificial intelligence is being used for self-driving vehicles.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:31.790
So instead of us generating information out in the form of pixels on displays,

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.710
we're also now processing information coming in.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.980
So radar, lidar, camera information all comes in to the NVIDIA system,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.670
and we're using artificial intelligence now to make sense of it.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.180
Now we have a specific product just for vehicles,

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.120
and it's called Drive PX.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.410
It's an AI supercomputer that has the power of over 150 MacBook Pros,

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.390
all in a very small form factor,

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.550
about the size of a license plate.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.930
Essentially, all the inputs come in to the Drive PX, from cameras,

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.685
from sensors like radar and lidar and ultrasonic all generating data.

00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:14.615
So our processor has to take all this information and make sense of it.

00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:17.070
Basically identify what's another vehicle,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.030
what's a pedestrian, what's a crosswalk, what's a sign.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.355
And all of this happens within a fraction of a second.

00:02:23.355 --> 00:02:26.455
We have cameras generating 30 frames every second,

00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:33.920
we have to analyze those frames and understand a full 360 environment around the vehicle.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:43.095
The GPU or graphics processing unit was invented by NVIDIA in 1999.

00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:45.590
This is a massively parallel processor,

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.180
and it's different from a CPU or central processing unit that you find in your PC.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.370
You've probably heard a CPU described as

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.810
a dual core or quad core and so essentially that means it is two lanes,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.220
or maybe four lanes of information that will flow through that CPU at once.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.695
The GPU on the other hand,

00:03:04.695 --> 00:03:07.275
has now over five thousand cores,

00:03:07.275 --> 00:03:11.860
so imagine if this was a highway instead of a two-lane highway or a four-lane highway,

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.205
we now have 5,000 lanes.

00:03:14.205 --> 00:03:15.330
So a lot of traffic,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.890
a lot of information can go through that processor simultaneously.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.270
And then, we're able to bring all that computational horsepower down into

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:30.500
that car in the Drive PX to the process all the sensor data in real time.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.805
Drive PX 2 is one of several products from NVIDIA that are all using deep learning.

00:03:39.805 --> 00:03:41.910
So we have the system for the car,

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.475
but other people who are developing can develop on a PC.

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:48.270
You can use deep learning in the cloud or

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.680
an embedded device called jets and if you're a hobbyist or a maker.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.300
The benefit of this unified architecture is again you develop

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.000
on one platform and you can deploy it on any platform.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.840
And so I think that's the challenge today is for

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.565
students and now the industry to develop new algorithms,

00:04:06.565 --> 00:04:08.350
new deep neural networks,

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.120
and leverage AI to build

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.930
a complete self driving cars system that is specific to the vehicle.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.875
Given the types of jobs out in the marketplace today and the lack of talent,

00:04:25.875 --> 00:04:29.550
I think there's a lot of opportunity for anyone just getting started who

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.665
can take courses to understand the fundamentals of computing today.

00:04:34.665 --> 00:04:40.000
And now there's a whole number of things that are unique to the self driving challenge,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.430
so understanding the complexity of what happens throughout the computing pipeline of

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:51.450
developing a self driving cars will be essential to getting a job in this industry.
