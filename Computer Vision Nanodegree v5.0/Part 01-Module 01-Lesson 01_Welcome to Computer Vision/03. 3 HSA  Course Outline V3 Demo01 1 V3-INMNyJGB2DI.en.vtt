00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.290
On your journey to becoming an expert in computer vision,

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.370
it will often be up to you to think about how humans reason and interpret information.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.254
And then learn techniques to translate that reasoning into code.

00:00:11.255 --> 00:00:15.480
In this course, we focus on three main areas of computer vision techniques,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.580
that are modeled on human understanding.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.014
First, we look at the foundational math and programming concepts

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:24.164
behind pattern recognition in classification tasks.

00:00:24.164 --> 00:00:27.809
This section will be all about creating algorithms that can one,

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:31.754
isolate important distinguishing information about an object in an image,

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:34.289
things like an objects unique shape or color.

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.530
And two, how do you ignore irrelevant parts of an image,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.914
things like a plane background or noise.

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:43.019
Second, we'll learn about deep learning algorithms that have

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.170
led to state of the art advances in computer vision technology.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.460
We'll cover architectures like region based convolutional neural networks,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.090
that identify where an object is in an image.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.025
And we'll talk about models that use recurrent neural networks.

00:00:56.024 --> 00:00:58.454
This section will be all about applications that

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:01.379
aim to reach human levels of scene understanding.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.390
Third, we'll discuss object tracking techniques.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.739
Using spatial information gathered over time,

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:10.964
you'll learn about predicting the location of an object and determining its movement.

00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:12.990
This is an ongoing area of research,

00:01:12.989 --> 00:01:17.189
especially in the field of autonomous vehicles like self driving cars and drones.

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.159
I'm really looking forward to covering such a variety of computer vision techniques.
