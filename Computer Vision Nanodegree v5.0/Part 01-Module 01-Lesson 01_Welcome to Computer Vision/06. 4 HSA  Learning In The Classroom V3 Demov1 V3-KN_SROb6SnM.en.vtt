00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
In this program, you'll learn from a variety of materials.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.619
instructional videos, quizzes, Python Code Notebooks, and projects.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.820
To get the most out of this course,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.015
it will be helpful to know what to expect from each of these sources.

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:15.825
Videos, like you've already seen are short informational lectures.

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:17.879
Some videos explain the theory behind

00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:20.759
a computer vision concept like image transformation,

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.700
and others show a practical code implementation.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.259
We make the video short,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.240
to isolate individual concepts,

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:28.409
and make it easy to review.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.719
So, feel free to pause and write notes,

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:33.359
or watch a video multiple times, if that helps you.

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:34.979
The program is self-paced,

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:37.049
so you can decide for yourself how many videos to

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:39.479
watch in one sitting and when to take a break.

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:42.479
Now, it's hard to know if you've gained knowledge from these videos,

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.654
unless you can apply that knowledge later on.

00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:47.355
That's why we built in three types of practice.

00:00:47.354 --> 00:00:49.559
First, in-between some of the videos,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.255
you'll find what we call quizzes.

00:00:51.255 --> 00:00:53.370
A quiz is typically a question that gets you

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:56.204
actively thinking about the material you've been taking in.

00:00:56.204 --> 00:01:00.224
Quizzes are meant to give you a quick indication of your own skill level and progress.

00:01:00.225 --> 00:01:01.440
If you struggle with a quiz,

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:03.509
it could mean that you should spend a little more time,

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:05.519
reviewing the concept it's asking about.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.694
And if a quiz seems relatively easy,

00:01:07.694 --> 00:01:09.434
it should encourage you to move on.

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:11.700
Second, in addition to quizzes,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.650
this course includes Python Notebooks for coding practice.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.680
Notebooks give you a chance to try out code,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.305
in a programming environment right in this classroom.

00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:23.130
These Notebooks are my preferred way of writing and testing out Python code,

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:24.689
and they're a great way to get used to running

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.605
computer vision Code and testing out your own functions and applications.

00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:31.770
Finally, you'll complete three Projects in this course.

00:01:31.769 --> 00:01:34.049
These are applications that are larger in scope than

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.629
the Notebook Code examples and they give you practice,

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:38.744
putting together multiple ideas.

00:01:38.745 --> 00:01:41.975
Projects will be Code reviewed by one of our technical reviewers.

00:01:41.974 --> 00:01:45.179
Meaning you'll get line by line feedback on what you're doing well,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.920
and what can be improved in your code.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.379
The project will really showcase your ability to

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:51.929
apply the skills you've learned throughout this course.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.610
As you progress with this program,

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.859
there are also several resources to help you keep moving forward,

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:58.679
and you can read about those next.
