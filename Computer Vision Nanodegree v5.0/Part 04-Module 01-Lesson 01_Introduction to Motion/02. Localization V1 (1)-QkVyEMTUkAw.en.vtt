00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
I'll be teaching this section in tandem with Sebastian Thrun,

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.679
who's been called "The Grandfather of Self-driving cars".

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:11.379
We'll start off by talking about representing motion and tracking objects in a video.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.300
Then, we'll move onto uncertainty and

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.655
robotic motion and learn a simple localization technique,

00:00:16.655 --> 00:00:19.970
the histogram filter, which can account for this uncertainty.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:22.509
Then, you'll learn about motion models and tracking

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.100
the position of a self-driving car over time.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.429
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.300
you'll have all the skills you need to code an implementation of SLAM,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.740
which stands for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.780
Slam is a technique that allows autonomous vehicles to build up a model of

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.750
the world while locating itself within that world. So, let's get started.
