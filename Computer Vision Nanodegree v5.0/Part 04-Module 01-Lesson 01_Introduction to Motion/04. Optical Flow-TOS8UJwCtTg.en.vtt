00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.450
Optical flow is used in many tracking and motion analysis applications.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.929
It works by assuming two things about image frames.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.869
One, that the pixel intensities of an object do

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.454
not change between consecutive frames and two,

00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:19.379
that neighboring pixels have similar motion.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:21.704
It then looks at interesting points, say,

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:24.433
corners or particularly bright pixels,

00:00:24.434 --> 00:00:27.679
and tracks them from one frame to the next.

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.439
Tracking a point or a set of points provides information about how

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.820
fast that point or object is moving and in what direction.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.049
This data also allows you to predict where an object will move next.

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:42.929
So you can use optical flow to do things like

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.744
hand gesture recognition or to track a certain object like a person or vehicle,

00:00:47.744 --> 00:00:49.829
and it's so much more powerful too.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.379
Motion recognition can be used to

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.410
distinguish between behaviors like running versus walking,

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.894
and in safety applications by predicting the motion of things and

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:03.005
performing obstacle avoidance like in the case of self-driving cars.

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:07.980
It's even used in eye tracking for virtual reality games and advertising.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.525
So, in many applications,

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:13.310
tracking and motion can add some very valuable information.
