00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.769
So far we've been looking at a lot of

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:11.689
static images and processing them to identify objects and interesting features,

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:16.429
and the exact same processing techniques can be used on a video stream.

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:21.230
This is because a video stream is just made up of a sequence of image frames.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.449
One thing we haven't talked about that's unique to

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.629
these sequences of image frames is the idea of motion.

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:31.544
For example, when you're watching this video you can see or envision

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:35.786
my hands move and to create an intelligent computer vision system,

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:39.855
we also want to give computers a way to understand motion.

00:00:39.854 --> 00:00:42.709
This is useful in a number of applications.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.704
Knowledge about motion is used to isolate moving pedestrians from a still background.

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:50.405
It's used in intelligent navigation systems,

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:52.280
in movement prediction models,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.700
and in distinguishing behaviors like running versus walking in a given video.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.550
One way to track objects over time and detect motion is by

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:07.039
extracting certain features and observing how they change from one frame to the next.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.120
Next we'll learn about one such method called optical flow.
