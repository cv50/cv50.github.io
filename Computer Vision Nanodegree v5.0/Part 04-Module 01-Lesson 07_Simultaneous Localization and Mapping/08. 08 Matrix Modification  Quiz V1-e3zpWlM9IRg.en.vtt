00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.299
I'm going to add one last thing here the initial robot location.

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:05.934
If we define x_0 to be zero,

00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:12.199
which is the origin of the map then what this means is we add one over here and

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:18.660
zero over here and the reason why is this constraint is that x_0 is zero.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.975
So let's take a robot moving around and let's see it sees a landmark,

00:00:22.975 --> 00:00:28.060
from the first pose x_0 and from the third pose x_2,

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:29.884
but not from the second pose.

00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:32.645
I want you in this matrix over here,

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:36.500
checkmark all the fields that are being modified by graham's law,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.405
to binary check and the same for the vector without putting actual numbers in.

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:43.734
So go to this matrix and ask yourself,

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:45.070
which fields will be zero,

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.039
the ones that are untouched and which ones will not be zero, the ones you will modified.
