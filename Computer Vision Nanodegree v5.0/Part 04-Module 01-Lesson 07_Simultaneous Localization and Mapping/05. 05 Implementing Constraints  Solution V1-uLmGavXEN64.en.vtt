00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.394
So, here's the answer. Let me just re-transform this as it's done over here.

00:00:04.394 --> 00:00:08.029
X1 minus x2 is now plus four,

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.084
and x2 minus x1 is minus four.

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:14.295
So, I have to add plus one over here,

00:00:14.294 --> 00:00:15.859
minus one over there,

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.504
plus one in this diagonal element over here,

00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:21.554
and minus one over here. Let me just do this.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:25.269
These numbers L, the end transform the first number over here to two.

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.289
We get a minus one for the off-diagonal elements, and a one over here.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.489
Now, we add four to the five,

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.655
which gives us a nine, and a minus four to the zero gives minus four.

00:00:36.655 --> 00:00:39.320
So, this is where we are now.
