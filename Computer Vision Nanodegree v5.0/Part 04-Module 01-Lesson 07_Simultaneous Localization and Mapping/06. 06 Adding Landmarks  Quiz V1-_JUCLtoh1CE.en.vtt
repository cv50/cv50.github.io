00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
Let me do another quiz.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:07.025
Supposing x_1, we see landmark L_0 at a distance of nine,

00:00:07.025 --> 00:00:10.740
this gives me a relative constraint between x_1 over

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.009
here and landmark zero, which is over here.

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:16.625
So just like before,

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:19.179
these link two things together relatively,

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.149
the x_1 and the L_0.

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.429
Now this doesn't look like a sub matrix,

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.545
but it's spread a little bit apart.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:28.090
But I want you to modify those four values in

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.164
the matrix and those two values in the vector to accommodate

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:37.839
that we believe the location of L_0 is nine greater than the robot position x_1.
