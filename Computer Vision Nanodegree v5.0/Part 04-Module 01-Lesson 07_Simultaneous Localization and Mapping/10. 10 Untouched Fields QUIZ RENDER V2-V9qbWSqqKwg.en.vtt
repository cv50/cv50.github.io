00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.865
Let me do the same quiz again.

00:00:01.865 --> 00:00:04.650
Now we have two landmarks and the picture I'm giving

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.150
you is a robot with three total positions.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.769
There's a landmark here, and a landmark here,

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.709
and say this landmark is being seen in these two positions,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.075
in these landmark, two poses,

00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:21.239
but landmark L_1 is not seen in X_2 and landmark L_2 is not seen in X_0.

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.994
And of the 30 fields over here,

00:00:23.995 --> 00:00:25.640
how many of them will never be touched?
