00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
And the correct answer is six for the following missing links.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.650
This guy here gives me two values in the matrix,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.669
this guy here another two and this link here is also missing.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.205
So it's another two. So it's six values missing.

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:15.824
Let's prove it to ourselves.

00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:19.515
Moving from x_0 to x_1 filter this area,

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:23.609
from x_1 to x_2, this area.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.390
So seeing end mark L_0 from x_0 and x_1 means you fill these guys over here

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.480
and the main diagonal there and seeing

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:37.814
the other end mark from x_1 and x_2 means we fill these guys over here.

00:00:37.814 --> 00:00:41.274
So let's count the ones that are still open and here're the other ones.

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:43.604
And my answer was actually wrong,

00:00:43.604 --> 00:00:45.750
it's eight. I overlooked.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.615
There's no direct link from L_1 to L_2 either.

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:51.600
So my apologies that I gave you the wrong number,

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.825
but it proves the utilization not an easy question.

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:57.870
It's harder than I thought and the reason is there's also

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:00.689
no direct link that constraints L_1 and L_2 directly.

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:02.099
Landmarks can't see.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.060
So they can't put a direct link between any two landmarks or put

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.740
differently in this part over here our matrix will always be a diagonal matrix.
