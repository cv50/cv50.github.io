00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.469
The answer is, our initial constraint would touch this guy over here.

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:08.064
The van to the second motion touches these things over here.

00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:09.464
The second to third,

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:13.089
these guys, and then the landmark observation over here.

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:16.239
Put something between x0 and the landmark,

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.229
that sits here, here,

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.719
here, here again and here.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:24.679
This observation over here put something between x2 in the landmark.

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.295
These guys over here, and the guys over here.

00:00:27.295 --> 00:00:32.100
That means we have only the following places that are still zero.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.765
This means there is no direct constraint between x2 and x0.

00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:38.880
There is this no direct motion information between these guys,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.370
and there's no direct constraint x1 and L,

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:44.189
which is this guy is missing over here.
