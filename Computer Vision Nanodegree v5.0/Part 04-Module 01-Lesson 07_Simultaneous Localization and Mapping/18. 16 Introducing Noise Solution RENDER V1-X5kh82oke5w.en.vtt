00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
So, I'm trying it out and see what happens.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.439
So, before it was minus 3, 2, 5, 7.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.030
Now, the first position is completely unchanged,

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:10.644
and I'll explain to you in a second why.

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:14.719
The third one, went from five to 5.5,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.295
and the landmark went down from seven to 6.8.

00:00:19.295 --> 00:00:23.140
So graphically, this guy becomes larger than five,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.030
and this landmark even shift a little bit to the left to make these two things

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.850
closer together than they were before when they had a separation distance of two.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.524
Now, this picture doesn't really explain it well because it's a 2D picture,

00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:38.185
but in 1D that's exactly what's happening.

00:00:38.185 --> 00:00:40.935
Also interesting, the initial position is unchanged.

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:42.609
So, these are the correct answers.

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:46.229
Now, I will be blown away if you guess them correctly.

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:48.859
The reason why the original position doesn't change is,

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.429
the only information we have about the absolute coordinates location is

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:57.859
the very first initial position anchor that we said it has to be minus three.

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:59.734
None of the relative rubber bands

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:02.710
change the fact that we need this guy to be minus three.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.870
A relative strength changed in

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.660
these two things over here means the rubber band is different,

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.004
but it's a relative thing.

00:01:09.004 --> 00:01:11.289
This is the only absolute constraint we put in.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.630
So, clearly, the absolute location of the first position doesn't change.

00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:18.489
The reason why it becomes larger than five is,

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:20.339
well, think about rubber bands.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.270
Our landmark is at around seven.

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:25.084
We believe to be a position five in the noise-free case,

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.244
we just put a tight rubber band between them.

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:29.725
It's not two anymore, it's now one.

00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:35.069
That means we're inclined to move the landmark and this position closer together,

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:36.744
and that's exactly what happens.

00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:39.780
If you go find a position, becomes 5.5,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.920
and the landmark becomes 6.875 instead of seven.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.355
Now, this is a case where the rubber bands don't add up.

00:01:47.355 --> 00:01:51.015
This is one of the places where graph's limit is just magical.

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:53.344
So, before everything adds up,

00:01:53.344 --> 00:01:55.885
but we have cycles in these structures,

00:01:55.885 --> 00:01:58.010
and these cycles might not add up,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.660
because we have noise and motionless measurements.

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.554
What our method does,

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.530
by computing this thing,

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.655
Omega to the minus one times c,

00:02:06.655 --> 00:02:11.104
we find the best solution to the relaxation of those rubber bands.

00:02:11.104 --> 00:02:14.479
That to me is sheer magic.
