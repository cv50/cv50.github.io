00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.675
He has a really tricky quiz.

00:00:01.675 --> 00:00:03.919
Let's look at the forward motion again.

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:10.019
Say I changed the last measurement from two down to one.

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.964
You might remember the robot poses,

00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:14.544
we minus three, two and five.

00:00:14.544 --> 00:00:17.550
Before their modification, then my position was seven.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.210
But if one doesn't really add up,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.500
a one suggests I might be at a different distance to the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.300
seven than the five over here that come from this side.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.769
So, here's my quiz.

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.089
First, I want you to know if I make this modification,

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.424
what is the effect on x2?

00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:39.409
Will the estimate be smaller than five as we shrink the robot path a little bit?

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:44.729
Will be exactly equals five like before or will be larger than five?

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:48.369
Also want to know what's the effect on x0.

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:49.859
Will it be smaller than minus three,

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.479
equal to minus three,

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:53.389
or larger than minus three?

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.359
This is a completely nontrivial quiz,

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:56.875
it takes really some thinking.

00:00:56.875 --> 00:01:00.600
Invest in thinking and you can even go back and try it out.
