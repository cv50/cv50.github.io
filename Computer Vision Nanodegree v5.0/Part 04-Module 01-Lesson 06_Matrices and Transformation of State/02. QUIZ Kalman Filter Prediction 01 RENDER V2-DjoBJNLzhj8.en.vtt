00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.674
In Kalma Filter then, we're going to build a two-dimensional estimate.

00:00:04.674 --> 00:00:11.429
One for the location and one for the velocity denoted x.

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.025
But it also can be 0,

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:15.734
it can be negative,

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:17.599
or it can be positive.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.859
If initially, I know my location but not my velocity,

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.634
then I represented Gaussian as elongated around the correct location.

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:31.840
But really, really broad in the space of velocities.

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:33.969
Now let's look at the predictions step.

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.990
In the prediction step, I don't know my velocity.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.075
So, I can't possibly predict for location I want to saw.

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:45.225
But miraculously, they have some interesting correlation.

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:47.379
So this for a second,

00:00:47.378 --> 00:00:49.789
just pick a point on this distribution over here.

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.960
Let me assume my velocity is 0.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.590
Of course in practice I don't know

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.335
the velocity but let me assume for a moment the velocity is 0.

00:00:57.335 --> 00:01:00.890
Where would my posture be after the prediction?

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.975
Well, we know we started location one,

00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:08.174
the velocity of 0, so my location would likely be here.

00:01:08.174 --> 00:01:12.079
Now let's change my belief of the velocity and pick a different one.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.545
Let's say the velocity is 1.

00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:18.340
Where would my prediction be one timestep later,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.040
starting at location one, and velocity 1?

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.210
I give you three choices.

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:30.014
Here, here, or here?

00:01:30.015 --> 00:01:32.680
Please pick the one that makes most sense.
