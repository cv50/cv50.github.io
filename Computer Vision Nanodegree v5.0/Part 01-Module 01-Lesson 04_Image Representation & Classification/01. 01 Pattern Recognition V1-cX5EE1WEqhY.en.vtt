00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
The first step in recognizing patterns in

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.910
images is learning how images are seen by computers.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.150
For example, say you want to find the boundary of an object.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.919
A common task is separating an object like a human from a background.

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.684
For us, it's easy to see where the background ends and the human begins.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.129
But how do we formalize this in code?

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:22.289
That's what this first lesson is all about.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.289
First, we'll talk about how images are represented as

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.250
numerical data and learn some foundational image processing techniques.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.454
Then, we'll learn how to extract

00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:36.500
distinguishing features about certain objects in an image like their color or shape.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.250
Near the end of this lesson,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.380
we'll get into deep learning techniques and

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.500
convolutional neural network structures that can learn how to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.320
extract these distinguishing features and can be

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.000
used in complex classification tasks. Let's dive in.
