00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.759
So now that we've seen how to treat images as

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:06.459
grids of pixels and as functions of x and y,

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:09.009
let's see how to use this information.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:11.289
We'll start by learning how to use information about

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.089
the colors in an image to isolate a particular area.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.634
This is an example of the computer vision pipeline step selecting areas of interest.

00:00:20.635 --> 00:00:23.630
This is easiest to understand in an example.

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:27.204
We'll be selecting an area of interest using a color threshold.

00:00:27.204 --> 00:00:29.469
Color thresholds are used in a number of

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:34.179
applications including extensively in computer graphics and video.

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:36.579
A common use is with a blue screen.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.509
A blue screen similar to a green screen is used to layer two images or

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:45.554
video streams based on identifying and replacing a large blue area.

00:00:45.554 --> 00:00:48.340
We're using a blue screen to film right now and

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.398
the blue background can be replaced so that it looks like I'm in a different room,

00:00:52.398 --> 00:00:59.702
underwater- I'm swimming, or even in outer space.

00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:02.070
So, how does all this work?

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.969
Well, the first step is to isolate

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.980
the blue background and then replace that blue area with an image of your choosing.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.704
This task seems simple enough,

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:14.000
so let's see how to do this in code with our own image.
