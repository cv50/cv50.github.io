00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.519
Semantic segmentation is the task of assigning meaning to part of an object.

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:07.994
This can be done at the pixel level where we assign

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:11.160
each pixel to a target class such as road,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.730
car, pedestrian, sign, or any number of other classes.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.335
Semantic segmentation help us derive valuable information about

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:24.750
every pixel in the image rather than just slicing sections into bounding boxes.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.969
This is a field known as scene understanding and

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:30.125
it's particularly relevant to autonomous vehicle.

00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.475
Full scene understanding help with perception,

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:35.000
which enables vehicles to make decisions.
