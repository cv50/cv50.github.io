00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.234
Now, using the second special technique,

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:06.419
we can create decoder of FCN's using transposed convolution.

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:08.789
A transpose convolution is essentially

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:13.480
a reverse convolution in which the forward and the backward passes are swapped.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.070
Hence, we call it transpose convolution.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.214
Some people may call it deconvolution because it undoes the previous convolution.

00:00:21.214 --> 00:00:24.945
Since all we're doing is swapping the order of forward and backward passes,

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:28.315
the math is actually exactly the same as what we've done earlier.

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:30.750
The property of differentiability is thus

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.000
retain and training is simply the same as previous neural networks.
