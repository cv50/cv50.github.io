00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
Our first task is object detection.

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:05.285
And for that, we can use bounding boxes.

00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:09.554
They are a simpler method of scene understanding compared to segmentation.

00:00:09.554 --> 00:00:12.254
In neural network, just has to figure out

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:15.500
where an object is and draw a type box around it.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.795
There are already great open source state of the art solutions,

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:21.970
such as YOLO and SSD models.

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:26.379
These models perform extremely well even at high frame per second.

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:29.640
They're useful for detecting different objects such as cars,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.435
people, traffic lights, and other objects in the scene.

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:36.330
However, burning boxes have their limits.

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.229
Imagine drawing and bounding box around a curvy road,

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:41.081
the forest, or the sky,

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:43.770
this quickly becomes problematic or even

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.065
impossible to convey the true shape of an object.

00:00:47.064 --> 00:00:52.229
At best, bounding boxes can only hope to achieve partial seen understanding.
